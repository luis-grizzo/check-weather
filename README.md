## üí≠ Motivation
Check Weather is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides current weather forecasts based on the user's location.

Its main objective is to serve as a study project for front-end development. In this project, I explored the caching functionality of server-side generated pages using Next.js to provide forecasts for as many locations as possible while minimizing the consumption of the OpenWeather API. Additionally, I studied the configuration of CI workflows on GitHub to execute tests on new pull requests.
